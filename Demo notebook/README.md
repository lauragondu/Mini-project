## Demo notebook

#### This notebook shows the graphs resulting from the Matflow simulations.

The results are not correct yet as I don't have the experimmental data to do the uniaxial and plane strain stress calibrations.

To run the code, I used the experimmental data from the uniaxial tensile test of an aluminium alloy sample (6XXX-T6).
