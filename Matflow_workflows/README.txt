	~~~ Dropbox (The University of Manchester) contents ~~~

This is my dropbox, where all the data and documents related to my PhD are stored.
Below, I describe what is inside every folder that contains the current folder:

>>> Advanced Metal Processing:
	Here I save the documents related to the AMP course.

>>> Matflow_Laura
	This folder is directly linked to Matflow. 
	Every time I run a Matflow script in CSF, the data are automatically stored here.

>>> Mini-project
	In this folder are saved all the data and documentation related to my mini-project,
	except the Matflow results that are directly stored in the Matflow_Laura folder.

>>> Software Engineering Practice
	This folder has the files generated for the group project we are doing for the
	Software Engineering Practice course.
